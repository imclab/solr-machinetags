This is a simple Solr schema for indexing machine tags. You could use it by
itself but it is here mostly as a reference and to be used as part of a larger
project-specific schema.

It basically works but there are still some known-knowns that need to be
addressed including:

* The indexer complains when the schema (correctly) defines the "value_float"
  field as a double. I think this has something to do with the regular
  expression.

* Because all the values for a given namespace/predicate field get indexed in
  the same multiValue bucket, the faceting doesn't behave the way you'd
  necessarily expect. For example, if you index the following...

	solr.add([{ 'id' : int(time.time()), 'body'·:·'float·thing',·'machinetag'·:·'dc:number=12345'·}])
	solr.add([{ 'id' : int(time.time()), 'body'·:·'decimal·thing',·'machinetag'·:·'dc:number=123.23'}])
	solr.add([{ 'id' : int(time.time()), 'body'·:·'negative·thing',·'machinetag'·:·['dc:number=-45.23',·'asc:test=rara']·}])

  ...and then facet on the predicates for ?q=ns:dc you end up with...

	"facet_fields":{
		"ns":[
			"asc",1,
			"dc",1]},

  ...which isn't really right, it is?

* The regular expression for values does not account for strings wrapped in
  quotes. I just haven't figured out how to escape it all in an XML attribute.
